					<hi class="page-title">about us</hi>
					<p>if you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance.
						
					<p class="dark">i need 500000+ amount of money.
i plan to make it towards next year.
i intend to give all my time all my energy and thoughts to earn that money.
my plan will be archieved by my desire to be a web developer.
i will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others.
i will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because i know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. i will cause others to believe in me, because i will believe in them, and in myself.
i will sign my self to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full faith that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that i will become a self-reliant, and successful person.
					</p>
					
					
*if the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it!</p>
