							<h3>website design</h3>
							<p>i need 500000+ amount of money.
i plan to make it towards next year.
i intend to give all my time all my energy and thoughts to earn that money.
my plan will be archieved by my desire to be a web developer.
i will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others.
i will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because i know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. i will cause others to believe in me, because i will believe in them, and in myself.
i will sign my self to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full faith that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that i will become a self-reliant, and successful person.</p>
							<p>pricing: $500,000 - $1200,000</p>
